# Runge-Kutta 2x2 Method in MATLAB

## Description

This repository contains the implementation of the **second-order Runge-Kutta** method to solve systems of second-order differential equations. This is part of a Numerical Analysis exam at UTN.

## Tech

The following technology was used in this project:

**GNU Octave:** An open-source alternative to MATLAB. You can run the code in Octave, which is available for free. Download GNU Octave from the following link: https://octave.org/download
